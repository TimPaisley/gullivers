# Gulliver's Guide to Wellington

> Every city is full of **undiscovered experiences** and **unseen vistas** eagerly awaiting a new group of ambitious explorers. Gulliver's Guide reveals your city's adventures and rewards the community for exploring.


## What is Gulliver's Guide?

This project provides a template for councils or communities to create their very own geo-location game (similar to Pok√©mon Go). The Guide consists of _Adventures_, which represent a geographically conjoined experience or group of thematically linked places around the city. Each Adventure consists of a number of Locations, and all _Locations_ must be visited in order to complete an Adventure.

## How will Gulliver's Guide be operated?

The intention is to create Gulliver's Guide for Wellington (New Zealand) to test and develop the project as a template that could be applied in other cities in the future.

The goal of this project is to help people all around the world explore their beautiful cities, regardless of size or financial wellbeing. For that reason, Gulliver's Guide will be free and open source, easily accessible and available for other city councils to use.

## How does Gulliver's Guide work?

The project is being written in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), which handles the API and [authentication](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise). After authentication, Rails serves a single-page web app written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/). We're using a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, together with the [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) extension.

## When will Gulliver's Guide be available?

At the moment, Gulliver's Guide is still in development, and we don't yet have a clear timeframe of when it might be playable.

If you're particularly invested in the future of this project, please get in touch and let us know. We're more likely to work faster if we know it's going to be valuable to someone.
